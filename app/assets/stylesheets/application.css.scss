/* CSS is based off of BassCss (http://www.basscss.com/)
 *
 * Most CSS is abstracted in the utilities or base folder. These classes
 * should be used for positioning(relative), layout (grid), spacing (padding, margins, etc.), colors,
 * and anything that can be abstracted away and used in multiple places
 *
 * For CSS that needs to be customized beyond these abstractions, create a componenet,
 * based on the RSCSS philosophy (https://github.com/rstacruz/rscss).  
 * Componenets should begin with a two word block, with encapsulated styles within the block
 * See any of the components for examples 
 *
 * If you are trying to get going quick, use the area below to put CSS that still needs to be refactored
 * And let the core team know in your Pull Request. 
 *
 * Don't worry too much, we're flexible :)
